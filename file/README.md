# AI-powered Adaptive Learning System

A blockchain-based adaptive learning system built on Stacks that automatically adjusts difficulty levels based on student performance.

## Overview

This system implements an intelligent learning platform that:
- Tracks student progress through different difficulty levels
- Automatically adjusts content difficulty based on performance
- Maintains secure, immutable records of student achievements
- Provides transparent assessment criteria

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

The system consists of the following main components:

1. **Student Profiles Management**
   - Student registration and profile creation
   - Progress tracking
   - Performance history storage

2. **Adaptive Difficulty System**
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment
   - Performance threshold management
   - Level progression rules

3. **Assessment Module**
   - Score submission and validation
   - Performance evaluation
   - Difficulty adjustment triggers

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Clarinet
- Node.js
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adaptive-learning-system
cd adaptive-learning-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Initialize Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet integrate
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations

- Access control mechanisms for administrative functions
- Input validation for all public functions
- Secure storage of student data
- Protection against gaming the difficulty system
